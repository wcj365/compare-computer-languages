# Computer Languages Popularity Test
We extract data from stackflow.com for Year 2018 and 2019.
The data represent the order of aggregate number of tags (programming languages, libraries, tools). 
We compare the change of ranking over two years.
We use Matplotlib and Altair for data visualization and show how a high level declarative tool Altair is much easier than the low level tool Matplotlib.
